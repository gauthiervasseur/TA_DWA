# 42 Series
## Master Markdown and Marp for lightning fast reporting


---


## Why


### The Narrative Reporting Imperative
- We need to report for decision, action and impact
- Human resource and time are too precious to be wasted
- Embrace Story Telling and Narrative BI
- Make the time to think and articulate your story
- Automate the reference and compliance reports

### Moving to Frictionless "Thought to Report" process
- Today, 70-90% of analysts time is spent on Powerpoint cosmetics
- That leaves little time for story telling
- Integration with LLM is clunky, impersonal and requires time consuming touch ups
- Relying 100% on GenAi solutions is non-deterministic

### What Markdown Can Do
- It can take your braindump into a a structured, high quality
  - Writeup
  - Brochure
  - Deck

### GenAi speaks Markdown
- The process can leverage the editing, wordsmithing and generated content straight from your favorite LLM

### FAIR Text Data
- Any text and content you generate is FAIR.
- It is text in its purest format, with just hte right amount of structuring markups
- It can be picked up, transformed, edited and worked on while keeping the most precise markup
- It can be restyled in seconds, regardless the size of the document - no more copy/paste styles and tedious style adjustment across a document

### We are not Picasso
- Unless it is for outside audience
- For internal, speed matters

## How to get setup

### Choose your IDE
- Markdown is a standard: It can be read by many solutions on the market
- Some free ones...
- Some paid ones...
- We will use VS Code

### Why VS code?

- The Add-ons
- The Microsoft suite
- The versatility to do more things such as run code (see Python for Analysts-42 Series), to create text-driven diagrams
- To easily manage you assets, images and styles
- To collaborate
- The integration in the process to generate slides

---

## How does it work?

### Header + Text + markup + css = FAIR content
- Your documents will start with a standard header that triggers the marp framework, the document options and the style that applies
- You text will then be written with small markers to define how it behaves and which style it is in, how pages or slides will be separated,

### Fonts, colors, Images and Backgrounds = great look

### Generate pdf, deck or brochures

### Follow your streamlined processes!
