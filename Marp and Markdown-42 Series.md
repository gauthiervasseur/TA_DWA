## Master Markdown and Marp for lightning fast reporting

## Why


### The Narrative Reporting Imperative

- We need to report for decision, action and impact
- Human resource and time are too precious to be wasted
- Embrace Story Telling and Narrative BI
- Make the time to think and articulate your story
- Automate the reference and compliance reports

### Moving to Frictionless "Thought to Report" process
- Today, 70-90% of analysts time is spent on Powerpoint cosmetics
- That leaves little time for story telling
- Integration with LLM is clunky, impersonal and requires time consuming touch ups
- Relying 100% on GenAi solutions is non-deterministic

### What Markdown Can Do
- It can take your branding into a a structured, high quality
  - Write-up
  - Brochure
  - Deck

---

### GenAi speaks Markdown
- The process can leverage the editing, wordsmithing and generated content straight from your favorite LLM

### FAIR Text Data
- Any text and content you generate is FAIR.
- It is text in its purest format, with just hte right amount of structuring markups
- It can be picked up, transformed, edited and worked on while keeping the most precise markup
- It can be restyled in seconds, regardless the size of the document - no more copy/paste styles and tedious style adjustment across a document

### We are not Picasso
- Unless it is for outside audience
- For internal, speed matters

## How to get setup

### Choose your IDE
- Markdown is a standard: It can be read by many solutions on the market
- Some free ones...
- Some paid ones...
- We will use VS Code

### Why VS code?
- The Add-ons
- The Microsoft suite
- The versatility to do more things such as run code (see Python for Analysts-42 Series), to create text-driven diagrams
- To easily manage you assets, images and styles
- To collaborate
- The integration in the process to generate slides

### The key add-ons
- Marp for VS Code
- Flutter Color
- Optional MarpItUp (to streamline and facilitate your process)
- CSV to Markdown
- Excel to Markdown

---

## How does it work?

### Header + Text + markup + css = FAIR content
- Your documents will start with a standard header that triggers the marp framework, the document options and the style that applies
- You text will then be written with small markers to define how it behaves and which style it is in, how pages or slides will be separated,

### Fonts, colors, Images and Backgrounds = great look

### Generate pdf, deck or brochures

### Follow your streamlined processes!

## The keys to Text Markup

Once the Markdown foundations are understood, you can work with your favorite LLM and ask it to provide you with the right notation to employ. Also, as you converse with it, it will naturally deliver its content in Markdown and you'll be able to paste it direcly in your deck or write-up.


### Text styling options
- Styles are defined in the CSS file
- They can define any detail of characters, layout etc.
- Here are a few core elements
  - font
  - color
  - size
  - weight and character style
  - indents
  - margin
  - padding
  - Line height
- Ask your favorite LLM to learn new ones and expand the finesse of your CSS setup

They are defined with this syntax structure:

    ```css
            h5{
            font-size: 12pt;    
            background: #FFFFFF;
            color: #123456;
            padding: 8px 14px;
            border: none;
            margin: 10px 0 12px;
            font-weight: 200;
            line-height: 1.6;
            }
    ```

### the base style

p is the base style applied when no markup is added.
It can be set to italic by adding * before and after, to bold by adding ** and bold-italic by adding ***


### the headers styles

### the ordered and unordered list styles

### The table styles
- Markdown tables are designed with special characters
- The drawback: it is not buildable easily
- The advantage: it can be styled fast and beautifully
- The trick: you design them in Excel or a csv editor and you paste them as Markdown
